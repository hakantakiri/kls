# KLS

Simple keyboard layout switcher for Gnome DE under a PopOS! installation

## Setup

- Script is executed running file `kls`. First give this file executiong permission running next command:
```
chmod +x ./kls
```

- Now place the script in an appropiate folder so it can be accesed and executed anywhere. I prefer to move my scripts to `/usr/local/bin/`:
```
sudo cp ./kls /usr/local/bin/kls
```

## Usage

Run `kls` followed by the specific layout you want to use. Current supported layouts are: `normal` , `mac`
```
kls mac
```
